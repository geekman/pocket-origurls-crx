Pocket Original URLs Chrome Extension
======================================
The getpocket.com website basically displays your saved articles with links 
that point to their site, so that they can format the article in a nicer
format. Note that there is also an "original link" URL at the bottom, and that
*also* points to their own server which then redirects you to the original site.

Obviously they do that to track your clicks, and obviously I don't like that.
That's why this extension exists to rewrite that original URL to... the
original URL.

Installation
-------------
Chrome has become really anal with extension security and will not allow you 
to install arbitrary extensions, especially on Windows. Upon restarting Chrome,
those unauthorized ones will be disabled.

The workaround is to load this extension as an "unpacked extension", as opposed
to in a shipped CRX form. Instructions can be found on Google's site here:
<https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted>.
